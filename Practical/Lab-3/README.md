# Singleton Design Pattern
Singleton Pattern says that just "define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it". 
In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.

### 2 forms of Singleton Design Pattern:
1. Early initialization:
   - creation of instance at load time
   - easy to use
   - occupies more memory space
2. Lazy initialization:
   - creation of instance when required
   -
